<h3><font color="dark blue">How I feel about the presure</h3></font>
<p>Frankly speaking I look forward for the exam so that it finishes.<br>
I would admitt that I am also a little nervous about it.<br>
The exam time seams to go on for a eternity.<br>
I do not feel very dishartened when I have done the papar very badly.<br>
Instead I feel very sad when 1 or 2 marks are left.</p>
<h3><font color="magenta"> How I feel when I am preparing for the exam</h3></font>
<p>I feel very bad when I am studying and the others are enjoying.<br>
On 8 March Captian Marvel is coming on the T.V. and I have the science exam on 11 March.<br>
But I do not take a lot of stress, actually I am writting this wepage when I have a exam  day after tommorow.</p>
<h3> <font color="red">How I Feel After The Exams</font></h3>
<p>I am so x100000 happy that I can't tell you.<br>
I hardly glace at the books.<br>
I do not even discuss the paper because then I get to know my mistakes so I go into depression.</p>
