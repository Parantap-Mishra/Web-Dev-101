<h3><font color="blue">Example of social engineering.</h3></font>
<p>
<img src="Picture1.jpg" style="float:right" height=200 width=300>
An attacker predents that he is from a company and calls Ram a office worker.<br>
Here is the conversation between attacker and Ram.</p>

</p>
<p>
The attacker will now be able to conduct an attack over Ram's account.

<h3><font color="red">Types of Social Engineering</h3></font>
<ol type="I">
<li>
 <b>Human Based Social Engineering</b>

 <li>
  <b>Computer-Based Social Engineering</b>
 </li>
</ol>
<h3><font color="brown">Human Based Social Engineering</h3></font>
<p>
Human Based Social Engineering use direct interactions to exploit or manipulate people for providing the confidential information.<br>
These attacks mainly use impersonation.<br> 
</p>
<p>
Methods of Human Based Social Engineering include-
<ol type="i">
<li>Eavesdropping</li>
<li>Shoulder Surfing</li>
<li>Dumpster Diving</li>
<li>Posing as legitimate end user</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3><font color="red">Guidelines for Social Engineering</h3></font>
<ul>
<li>Categorize the information as the top secret, for internal use only, for public use etc.</li>
<li>Be suspicious of unwanted phone calls, visits or emails from individuals asking your personal information.</li>
<li>Do not believe everything what they say, instead try to verify.</li>
<li>Install and maintain anti-virus software, firewall and email filters to reduce the malicious traffic.</li>
<li>There should be administrator, user and guest accounts with proper authorization.</li>
<li>Know the personal who has called you and try to verify his/her identity.</li>
<li>Ensure security of the critical information and authourized use of resources.</li>
<li>Enable anti-phishing features offered by your email client and web browzer.</li>
<li>Do not give important personal information over the internet before checking a website's security.</li>
