	<font size="5">
		<p>The path to the future first made way in December 1955 when Herbert Simon and Allen Newell develop the Logic Theorist, the first artificial intelligence program, which eventually would prove 38 of the first 52 theorems in Whitehead and Russell's Principia Mathematica.But it wasn't properly built until 1956 when AI is created by John Mccarthy. The field of AI wasn't formally founded until at that time, at a conference at Dartmouth College, in Hanover, New Hampshire, where the term <b>"artificial intelligence" </b>was coined.
		</p>
		<p>However, despite this well-funded global effort over several decades, computer scientists found it incredibly difficult to create intelligence in machines. To be successful, AI applications (such as vision learning) required the processing of enormous amount of data. Computers were not well-developed enough to process such a large magnitude of data. Governments and corporations were losing faith in AI.</p>
		<p>1974–80 then became known as the "AI winter." The field later revived in the 1980s when the British government started funding it again in part to compete with efforts by the Japanese.The field experienced another major winter from 1987 to 1993, coinciding with the collapse of the market for some of the early general-purpose computers, and reduced government funding.

			<b>Breakthroughs</b>
			<li>Kismet, one of the first robot heads in technological advancement was made in the late 1990s at Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Dr. Cynthia Breazeal.</li>
			<li>IBM’s Deep Blue defeated and became the first computer to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>But it was not until the 2000’s that many of the landmark goals were achieved and AI thrived despite lack of government funds and public attention.</p>

			<b>Other Milestones</b>
			<li><b>Siri- </b> It was introduced as a built-in feature with the Apple iPhone 4S smartphone. A voice-activated personal assistant, Siri could “understand” natural language requests and also adjust the information it retrieved from the web by learning user tendencies and preferences. Siri could perform a wide number of functions – from recommending local restaurants (using the web and the iPhone’s built-in GPS navigation system), providing walking or driving directions, giving weather forecasts, showing current sports scores, and even answering seemingly meaningless questions like, “Who is your favorite NCAA college football team?”</li>
			<li><b>Alexa- </b>In 2014 november, Alexa was resealed created by amazon with almost the same functions as Siri.</li>
			<li><b>Sophia- </b> Sophia is a social humanoid robot developed by Hong Kong-based company Hanson Robotics. Sophia was first turned on February 14, 2016,and made her first public appearance at South by Southwest Festival (SXSW) in mid-March 2016 in Austin, Texas, United States.
			Sophia has been covered by media around the globe and has participated in many high-profile interviews. In October 2017, Sophia "became" a Saudi Arabian citizen, the first robot to receive citizenship of any country. In November 2017, Sophia was named the United Nations Development Programme's first ever Innovation Champion, and is the first non-human to be given any United Nation title.

			<li><b>Google Home- </b> Google home, launched on 2016 is also an example of AI.</li>

		<p>Today, the amount of data that is generated, by both humans and machines, far outpaces humans’ ability to absorb, interpret, and make complex decisions based on that data. Artificial intelligence forms the basis for all computer learning and is the future of all complex decision making. As an example, most humans can figure out how to not lose at tic-tac-toe (noughts and crosses), even though there are 255,168 unique moves, of which 46,080 end in a draw. Far fewer folks would be considered grand champions of checkers, with more than 500 x 1018, or 500 quintillion, different potential moves. Computers are extremely efficient at calculating these combinations and permutations to arrive at the best decision. AI (and its logical evolution of machine learning) and deep learning are the foundational future of business decision making.</p>
		<h2>Everyday Usage</h2>
		<p>Applications of AI can be seen in everyday scenarios such as financial services fraud detection, retail purchase predictions, and online customer support interactions. Here are just a few examples: </p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Fraud detection-</b> The financial services industry uses artificial intelligence in two ways. Initial scoring of applications for credit uses AI to understand creditworthiness. More advanced AI engines are employed to monitor and detect fraudulent payment card transactions in real time.</li>
			<li><b>Virtual customer assistance (VCA)- </b> Call centers use VCA to predict and respond to customer inquiries outside of human interaction. Voice recognition, coupled with simulated human dialog, is the first point of interaction in a customer service inquiry. Higher-level inquiries are redirected to a human.</li>
			<li>When a person initiates dialog on a webpage via chat (chatbot), the person is often interacting with a computer running specialized AI. If the chatbot can’t interpret or address the question, a human intervenes to communicate directly with the person. These noninterpretive instances are fed into a machine-learning computation system to improve the AI application for future interactions.</li>
